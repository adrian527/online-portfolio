                    In the 3rd year of high school, I became a finalist in the nationwide economics knowledge
                    competition. During the competition, I deepened my knowledge in the fields of macro and
                    microeconomics, as well as management, finance and marketing. The contest consisted of several
                    stages, and I achieved the 3rd place in the whole country in the second stage. The theme of my
                    edition revolved around the impact of the state on the economy. As part of the prize, I participated
                    in lectures held at the Central Bank of Poland. You can go to main page of this contest by clicking
