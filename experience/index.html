            <h1 class="mar-t-2">Experience</h1>
            <p>With a passion for crafting innovative, user-friendly, and visually appealing digital experiences, I've
                had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that span different industries and technologies.
                Whether it's front-end development, user interface design, or API integrations, I've strived to create
                solutions that not only meet the needs of clients but also delight users. Please explore professional
                experience section to get&nbsp;a&nbsp;glimpse of my work. In this section, I added links to less known
                technologies, the list of all technologies can be found in the <a href="../education/"

                                from scratch, employing HTML and CSS. I've also been working on enhancing the onboarding
                                form I initially developed during my internship, extending it to accommodate different

                                Team collaboration is a significant part of my role, which involves tasks such as

                                regularly conduct demos to showcase the administrative panel to company employees. On a

                                To facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend, we implemented an
                                openAPI solution. Furthermore, we optimized our frontend architecture by adopting a yarn
                                workspaces approach, allowing us to create distinct front-end modules.</td>
