# Adrian Gzyl online portfolio

This is an online rendition of my CV, designed to be more interactive and engaging, leveraging fundamental front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
## Manual

The centerpiece of this page is a captivating game where users can navigate a spaceship using arrow controls in the bottom corner. 
When the spaceship approaches a UFO, a 'Visit' button becomes available, allowing users to explore my portfolio sections, which include education, work experience, and various projects.

## Resources

Within the webpage, I have also included links to my other projects, as well as resources and organizations relevant to my professional background. Feel free to explore everything, and I hope you have a great time browsing through my online CV!
